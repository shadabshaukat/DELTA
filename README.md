# DELTA
## DB(D)  Endpoint(E)  Latency(L)  Testing(T)  Ammeter(A)

üì£ Annoucing a new tool to calculate Cloud Database endpoint latency using SQL queries

üìå Introducing DELTA (DB Endpoint Latency Testing Ammeter). DELTA is a tool to test real-world latency against a remote database using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. The tool provides functions to test latency of Oracle, MySQL and Postgres databases. The tool uses the cx_Oracle, psycopg2 and pymysql packages to connect to the respective databases and execute a single query per request (you can specify multiple requests as well). The tool uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. The tool then calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests.

üîß DELTA is a cloud tool to test real-world latency against a remote database endpoint using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. 


üîß Network tools like ping ,iperf or tcp ping can only give you network based latency which does not always translate well to an application running those queries on a remote database. 


üêç DELTA uses Python client for Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL to run a query like ‚ÄúSELECT 1‚Äù or "SELECT 1 FROM DUAL". You can then specific the number of executions of the query and DELTA calculates the average network round-trip time for all the executions of the query on the remote database. The script also includes error handling to track failed requests. You can also include your own custom queries.

## How it works
The function 'measure_latency_oracle' uses the cx_Oracle package to connect to the Oracle database and execute a single query per request. The function uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. The function then calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests. The function opens a new connection for every request and closes it after fetching the results, which will measure the time it takes to execute the query, transfer the data over the network, and close the connection. The query parameter is passed to the function, allowing you to test the performance of the database with different queries. The same logic applies to the functions of mysql and postgres

# Requirements

    Python 3 (Minimum 3.7)
    cx_Oracle
    psycopg2-binary
    pymysql

# Installation

You can install the packages individually or all together using the requirements.txt file 

$ git clone https://github.com/shadabshaukat/DELTA.git

$ cd DELTA

$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

OR

$ pip3 install cx_Oracle
$ pip3 install psycopg2-binary
$ pip3 install pymysql

# Usage

The tool can be run using the command line. You will need to provide the following arguments:

    dbtype : The type of database you want to test. Can be 'oracle', 'mysql' or 'postgres'
    num_of_requests : The number of requests you want to make to the database
    username : The username to connect to the database
    password : The password to connect to the database
    hostname : The hostname or IP address of the database
    portnumber : The port number of the database
    databasename : The name of the database
    "SQL QUERY" : The SQL query you want to test
    
  ## Autonomous Oracle DB ##
  $ python3 main.py oracle <num_of_requests> <username> <password> 'hostname:portnumber/servicename' "SQL QUERY"
  
eg: python3 main.py oracle 10 admin YourP@ssw0rd1234#  '(description= (retry_count=20)(retry_delay=3)(address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1521)(host=******.adb.ap-melbourne-1.oraclecloud.com))(connect_data=(service_name=*********_testdelta_high.adb.oraclecloud.com))(security=(ssl_server_dn_match=yes)))' "SELECT 1 from DUAL"
 
 ### Note

In case of autonomous database, the connecting string can be found in OCI Console > Autonomous Database > DB Connection .

# Function Definitions
measure_latency_oracle(user,password,dsn,num_requests,query)

This function is used to measure the latency of an Oracle database. It takes in the following parameters:

    user: The username to connect to the Oracle database.
    password: The password to connect to the Oracle database.
    dsn: The hostname and portnumber/servicename of the Oracle database.
    num_requests: The number of requests to be made to the database.
    query: The SQL query to be executed on the database.

It returns the average latency in seconds and milliseconds, the number of successful requests and any errors that occurred during the test.
