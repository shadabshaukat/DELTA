# DELTA
## DB(D)  Endpoint(E)  Latency(L)  Testing(T)  Ammeter(A)

📣 Annoucing a new tool to calculate Cloud Database endpoint latency using SQL queries

📌 Introducing DELTA (DB Endpoint Latency Testing Ammeter). DELTA is a tool to test real-world latency against a remote database using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. The tool provides functions to test latency of Oracle, MySQL and Postgres databases.

The tool uses the oracledb, psycopg2 and pymysql packages to connect to the respective databases and execute a single query per request (you can specify multiple requests as well). The tool uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. It calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests.

🔧 DELTA is a cloud tool to test real-world latency against a remote database endpoint using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. 


🔧 Network tools like ping ,iperf or tcp ping can only give you network based latency which does not always translate well to an application running those queries on a remote database. 


🐍 DELTA uses Python client for Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL to run a query like “SELECT 1” or "SELECT 1 FROM DUAL". You can then specific the number of executions of the query and DELTA calculates the average network round-trip time for all the executions of the query on the remote database. The script also includes error handling to track failed requests. You can also include your own custom queries. 


## How it works
The function 'measure_latency_oracle' uses the oracledb package to connect to the Oracle database and execute a single query per request. The function uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. The function then calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests. The function opens a new connection for every request and closes it after fetching the results, which will measure the time it takes to execute the query, transfer the data over the network, and close the connection. The query parameter is passed to the function, allowing you to test the performance of the database with different queries. The same logic applies to the functions of mysql and postgres

## Autonomous Database Latency Check using SQL Query

#### Note : This option uses python-oracledb package in thin mode


```
docker run -it delta python3 main.py \
autonomous \
1 \
admin \
YourP@ssw0rd \
'(description= (retry_count=20)(retry_delay=3)(address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1521)(host=*******.adb.ap-melbourne-1.oraclecloud.com))(connect_data=(service_name=********_testdelta_high.adb.oraclecloud.com))(security=(ssl_server_dn_match=yes)))' \
"SELECT 1 from DUAL"
```

- In case of Oracle Autonomous database, the connecting string can be found in OCI Console > Autonomous Database > DB Connection
- Currently only non-mTLS connections are supported. mTLS with wallet should be available soon


## Oracle Database Latency Check using SQL Query

#### Note : This option uses python-oracledb package in thick mode

```
docker run -it delta python3 main.py \
oracle \
1 \
hr \
YourP@ssw0rd  \
'host:port/servicename' \
"SELECT 1 from DUAL" 
 ```
 
 
 ## Oracle Database Latency Check using OCIping()

#### Note : This option uses the Oracle Python driver in thick mode and can only be used for Non-Autonomous Oracle Database. It does not require a SQL query but sends multiple requests using connection.ping() method


```
 docker run -it delta python3 main.py \
 ociping \
 100 \
 hr \
 YourP@ssw0rd   \
 'host:port/servicename' 
 ```
 
This function uses ping() [1] in python-oracledb thick mode which is a wrapper around OCIPing() function [2]

# Function Definitions

### Important Note on Oracle Database Python Package performance
By default, python-oracledb runs in a ‘Thin’ mode which connects directly to Oracle Database. This mode does not need Oracle Client libraries. However, some additional functionality is available when python-oracledb uses them. Python-oracledb is said to be in ‘Thick’ mode when Oracle Client libraries are used. Both modes have comprehensive functionality supporting the Python Database API v2.0 Specification.

There are two ways to create a connection to Oracle Database using python-oracledb:

    Standalone connections: Standalone connections are useful when the application needs a single connection to a database. Connections are created by calling oracledb.connect().

    Pooled connections: Connection pooling is important for performance when applications frequently connect and disconnect from the database. Pools support Oracle’s high availability features and are recommended for applications that must be reliable. Small pools can also be useful for applications that want a few connections available for infrequent use. Pools are created with oracledb.create_pool() at application initialization time, and then ConnectionPool.acquire() can be called to obtain a connection from a pool.
